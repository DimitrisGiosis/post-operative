Post-operative patient database for WEKA

An example has been taken from the collection of the University of California, Irvine (USA) under the name Post-Operative Patient Database.

This is based on a real problem. Given a current inpatient at the post-operative stage, the idea is to determine the best place for the patient to continue his/her recovery on the basis of certain data (list of attributes) obtained from the relevant medical tests.

Patient-associated information (list of attributes):

    Internal temperature.
    Surface temperature.
    Oxygen concentration.
    Blood pressure.
    Stability of surface temperature.
    Stability of internal temperature.
    Level of wellness shown.

The decision taken will lead to the patient being sent to (distribution of classes):

    (I) ICU (Intensive Care Unit).
    (S) Home (discharge).
    (A) A general hospital ward.

The code (post-operative.arff, and instance.arff) is modified for WEKA (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis).
